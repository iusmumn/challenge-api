# challenge-api

The backend service for interacting with project challenge database.

# Getting Started

Before you start, please check that the following are installed:

- python3
    ```bash
    $ python3 --version
    ```

- pip3
    ```bash
    $ pip3 --version
    ```

## Setup your virtual environments

Virtual environments in Python allow us to download Python libraries (also known as packages) for our project without installing them globally, i.e. on your machine.

### Installation

To install `virtualenv` run:

```bash
$ pip3 install virtualenv
```

Setup `virtualenv` in this project:

```bash
$ git clone git@github.com:iusmumn/challenge-api.git
$ cd challenge-api/
$ virtualenv venv
```

You will also notice that a `venv/` directory was created. This is where all your future Python packages for this project will be downloaded to from now on!

_Note: This only has to be done once. No need to do it again when developing._

### Usage

Whenever you develop on this project, please run through the following process!

1. Activate `virtualenv`

    ```bash
    $ source venv/bin/activate
    ```

    - You should see a `(venv)` appear in your terminal indicating you are now in a virtual environment!
    
    - Now we can freely install Python packages we may need using `pip3` ðŸš€

1. Install any Python packages you may need

    ```bash
    $ pip3 install <package_name>
    ```
    Example:
    ```
    $ pip3 install flask
    ```

1. When you are done developing, exit the virtual environment like so

    ```bash
    $ deactivate
    ```

## Running the API

Follow these steps to run the Flask API server

1. Activate `virtualenv`

    ```bash
    $ source venv/bin/activate
    ```

1. If you haven't alerady, install the `flask` package

    ```bash
    $ pip3 install flask
    ```

1. Run the server

    ```bash
    $ python3 api.py
    ```
    
    Alternatively, you can also run it like this:

    ```bash
    $ export FLASK_APP=api.py
    $ flask run
    ## Or if you want to be fancy
    $ FLASK_APP=api.py flask run
    ```

1. Test the server

    ```bash
    $ curl http://localhost:5000/
    # should return the following
    > Hello, from Challenge API!
    ```
